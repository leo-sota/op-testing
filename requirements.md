Project Proposal: Blockchain-Based Decentralized Identity (DID) and Trust-Anchored Transaction Platform

1. Project Title
Development of a Blockchain-Based Decentralized Identity (DID) and Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)-Powered Trust-Anchored Transaction Platform

2. Project Objectives
This project aims to fundamentally resolve the rampant issue of personal information leaks in current online services, provide users with robust personal security, and ensure transaction stability and trustworthiness in a decentralized environment. Through this, we seek to demonstrate the practical utility of blockchain technology and lead its mainstream adoption.

Solving Personal Information Leakage and Enhancing Personal Security:

To establish a Decentralized Identity (DID) system that allows users to fully own and control their identity information, free from reliance on central authorities.

To integrate Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology as a core component, enabling users to prove their identity and qualifications without directly revealing sensitive personal data, thus fundamentally preventing personal information leaks.

Ensuring Transaction Stability and Trustworthiness:

To provide transaction negotiation features via P2P chat and execute agreed-upon transactions securely through blockchain-based escrow smart contracts.

To permanently record all transaction details on the blockchain, preventing forgery and maximizing transparency to build trust between transacting parties.

Contributing to Real-World Application and Popularization of Blockchain Technology:

To implement complex blockchain technologies like DID, ZKP, and smart contracts with a user-friendly UI/UX, making them easily accessible and usable for the general public.

To integrate diverse real-world applications such as forums, P2P chat, document management, and electronic signatures, demonstrating the practical value of blockchain technology.

3. Key Features and Contents
3.1. Blockchain-Based Decentralized Identity (DID) System (Core: ZKP Integration)
DID Generation and Management: Users can generate unique DIDs and securely store and manage their associated encrypted personal information.

Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)-Based Identity/Credential Verification:

Users can prove the validity of their sensitive information (e.g., age, specific qualification) without directly disclosing it, using ZKPs.

Development of a smart contract module to efficiently verify ZKPs on-chain.

Selective Disclosure: Ensures maximum privacy by allowing users to selectively disclose only the necessary parts of their identity information.

DID Recovery and Revocation: Includes mechanisms for DID recovery in case of loss and secure DID revocation when needed.

3.2. Trust-Anchored P2P Transaction System (Integrated with Forum and Chat)
Enhanced Forum Functionality:

Provides categorized discussion boards and advanced search/filtering features, enabling users to efficiently explore and discuss transaction-related information.

Introduces a reputation system linked with ZKP-based identity verification, offering a trust score based on user transaction history and community contributions to help identify reliable trading partners.

P2P Chat-Based Transaction Negotiation:

Within P2P chat rooms, users can create and send transaction proposals for specific items/services, negotiate terms (quantity, price, payment method, etc.), and reach agreements.

Blockchain-Based Escrow Transaction Execution:

Implements an escrow smart contract based on agreed transaction terms to securely hold funds (cryptocurrency) and automatically release them upon fulfillment of conditions.

In case of disputes during a transaction, the contract is designed to handle funds according to pre-defined rules or decentralized arbitration mechanisms.

On-Chain Transaction Record:

All major transaction stages (proposal, agreement, escrow deposit, completion, etc.) are recorded on the blockchain via smart contract events, providing an immutable and permanent transaction history that cannot be forged.

Key information such as transacting parties (DID), transaction amount, a summary of transaction content (e.g., IPFS hash link to documents), and transaction status (pending, complete, dispute) is stored on-chain.

3.3. Integrated Website Platform Features
Easy Login and Registration: Secure and fast website login/registration using ZKP-based DID (leveraging and extending the smart contract already deployed on Sepolia).

Dashboard: A personalized dashboard providing an overview of user DID, transaction history, forum activity, and personal messages.

Blog Management: Enables users to create and manage their own content.

Document Management and Electronic Signatures: Provides electronic signature and anti-tampering verification features for important documents, utilizing blockchain-recorded DIDs.

User-Friendly UI/UX: Designed to abstract complex blockchain technology and provide an intuitive, easy-to-use interface, making it accessible to all users.

Security: System design prioritizes data integrity and personal information security using DLT characteristics of blockchain and ZKP, including plans for smart contract security audits.

4. Expected Outcomes
Root Cause Elimination of Personal Information Leaks: ZKP enables identity verification without exposing sensitive personal information, fundamentally resolving the personal information leak issues prevalent in traditional centralized systems.

Establishment of Personal Data Sovereignty: Users gain complete control over their identity and data, ushering in an era of true data sovereignty.

Secure and Trustworthy Transaction Environment: Minimizes the risk of fraud in P2P transactions through escrow smart contracts and blockchain's immutability, building a transparent and verifiable transaction system.

Reduction of Societal Trust Costs: Lowers overall societal trust costs by enabling P2P trust and transactions without intermediaries.

Popularization and Expansion of Blockchain Technology: By implementing complex blockchain technologies into easily applicable real-world services, it contributes to increasing public understanding and utilization of blockchain.

Creation of New Business Models: Fosters new market opportunities by identifying and activating diverse blockchain applications based on DID and ZKP.
